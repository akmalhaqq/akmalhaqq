Welcome to my GitHub 🧛‍♂️  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🧠 About this place

Think of this GitHub as my **public learning playground**.

I’m a Computer Science student who asks **“why?”** a little too often.  
Sometimes before coding.  
Sometimes after coding.  
Sometimes while staring at the screen, hoping clarity loads faster than my laptop fan.

Here, I document my journey through projects, competition work, and experiments.  
Some repositories are clean.  
Some are… *educationally chaotic*.  
Not perfect.  
Not instant.  
Just honest progress.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🚀 Why I keep everything here

This profile is my way of staying accountable.

By making my work public, I can track progress instead of just *feeling* productive,  
revisit old code and ask *“who wrote this?”* (it was me).

If something here helps you, that’s amazing.

## 📖 Just motivation (read this when stuck)

There’s one article I always come back to:

## 🧠 Personal mantra 

> If it feels hard, it means I’m exactly where I should be.  
> Growth rarely feels comfortable and that’s okay.

## 🌱 A small promise to myself

No shortcuts.  
No pretending to know everything.  
No rushing clarity.
No “I’ll fix this later” (I will forget).

Just consistent effort, honest mistakes,  
and steady improvement 

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 😄 Final note

If you’re here to explore,  welcome 🤝  
If you’re here to learn,  let’s struggle productively together  
If you’re just scrolling, I hope this page made you smile a little 🙂

you’re officially part of the README speedrun.

Still learning. Still improving.  
Trying my best and occasionally pretending I know what I’m doing.
